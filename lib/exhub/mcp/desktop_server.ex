defmodule Exhub.MCP.DesktopServer do
  @moduledoc """
  MCP Server for desktop/filesystem/process control — inspired by DesktopCommanderMCP.

  ## Purpose
  Provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with the local filesystem
  and running system processes. Designed for AI agents that need to read, write,
  edit, search, and manage files, as well as execute and monitor shell commands.

  ## Tool Categories

  ### Filesystem
  - `read_file`        — Read file contents with optional line offset/limit
  - `write_file`       — Write or append content to a file
  - `create_directory` — Create a directory (and parents) recursively
  - `list_directory`   — List directory contents with optional recursion depth
  - `move_file`        — Move or rename a file or directory
  - `get_file_info`    — Get metadata (size, type, timestamps) for a path
  - `delete_file`      — Delete a file or directory (optionally recursive)

  ### Editing
  - `edit_block`       — Targeted find-and-replace edit within a text file

  ### Process / Terminal
  - `execute_command`  — Run a shell command and return its output (uses Exile)
  - `start_process`    — Start a long-running command, returns process_id
  - `read_process_output` — Read output from a managed process
  - `list_managed_processes` — List all tracked processes
  - `terminate_process` — Terminate a managed process
  - `list_processes`   — List all system processes (uses Exile)
  - `kill_process`     — Kill a system process by PID (uses Exile)

  ### Search
  - `search_files`     — Search for files by name or search inside file contents

  The server is accessible at `/desktop/mcp`.
